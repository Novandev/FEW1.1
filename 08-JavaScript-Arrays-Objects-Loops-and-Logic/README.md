# JavaScript Arrays, Objects, and Loops

Arrays, Objects are core data structures in JavaScript.
Use them to hold and organize data used in the programs
you write.

Use loops to automate repetative tasks.

Hoisting, const, let, var

## Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Variables and scope
1. Define Arrays and Objects
1. Access values stored in arrays and Objects
1. Use loops to automate processes working with arrays and objects
1. Work with nested data structures

  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting
  - Now think of an example that explains hoisting
  - You can declare variables and functions before using them
- Variables can be declared with const, let, and var
  - var: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
    - Now think of an example that explains var
    - var is function scope! This includes for loops that declare inside of the () like this (for var i)
  - const: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const
    - Think of an example that explains const
    - Const can not be re assigned but can put pushed, or concantianted
  - let: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
    - Think of an example that explains let
    - block scope so there can be multiple let =x as long as theyre blocked
    - lets are better inside of for loops.
- Review functions and variables
  - const, let, and var
  - scope

## Overview

- Objects and Arrays are compound data types.
  - Use arrays to organize data into an ordered collection
  - Use Objects organize data into key value pairs

## In Class Activity I

- Exploring Array
  - Properties: length
  - Accessing elements with: []

Try the challenges in [Example 1](example-1). Read the challenges in the comments. There are 4 challenges.

## After Class

- Continue Cookie Clicker Tutorial
- Work on the challenges [here](challenges.md)
- The goal of this assignment was to see that content can be handled
dynamically. Your job is to apply this concept to your personal site.
  - Look at your personal website and identify where content
could handled dynamically.
  - Create a JavaScript Object or Array that holds all of the content
  your site displays.
